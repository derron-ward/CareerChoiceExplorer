## Pushing Changes to the Repository
This repository has 2 protected branches (`main` and `dev`). The `main` branch is used to store working code that is ready for deployment and the 
`dev` branch is used for code that is in development. Code **cannot** be pushed directly to these 2 branches. Code must be pushed to a new branch and a pull request must be made to get the code merged.

## Pull Requests
As mentioned above, a pull request must be made to merge with `main` or `dev`. When creating a pull request, be as descriptive of the changes as possible. A pull request must be reviewed by **at least** 1 person, before the code is merged into a protected branch.
